# Ceramics Studio Website

Welcome to the Ceramics Studio Website project! This is a small HTML and Sass project designed for a ceramics studio. The website features multiple pages including a home page, about page, product page, reference page, and a contact page. The site is built with responsiveness in mind using flexbox layout techniques and follows the WCAG 2.1 standards for web accessibility.

This project serves as the first course assignment in our current education and aims to showcase our understanding of HTML, Sass, responsive design, and accessibility principles.
